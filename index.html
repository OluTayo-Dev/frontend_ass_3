            <p>aren't, so today is the one day a year that many companies allow their employees to bring their pup</p>
            <p>to them. Some workplaces are so fantastic that dogs are welcome all year round! While it's obviously</p>

                <h2>The future of Amazon drone deliveries</h2>
                <p>Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has filed for a patent for beehive-like towers that would serve as multi-level</p>
                <p>fulfillment centers for its delivery drones to take off and land. The facilities would be built vertically</p>
                <p> to blend in with high rises in urban areas. Amazon envisions each city would have one. The patent application,</p>
                <p>filed in December 2015 and published on Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, features several drawings</p>
                <p>of these buildings, such as the beehive, a cylinder-shaped center and one that looks like a UFO</p>

                <p>short of perfection. At around Â¥20,000 ($200) per person, it's a splurge, but perfection doesn't come cheap.</p>
